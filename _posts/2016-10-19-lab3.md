title: "Lab 3: A Quarter-Car Suspension Model (Week 7)"
categories: lab
---

A quarter-car suspension model is similar to the video simulation shown in lecture,
in that two masses are connected by springs. However, in the car suspension, there
are also dampers connecting the two masses, as shown:

![car](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/me300/car.PNG)

The lower mass (the unsprung mass) includes the wheel and suspension arm assembly.
It is connected to the road surface by the tire and has parameters as follows:

- Weight of 50 lbf.
- Spring rate of the tire is 1200 lbf/in.
- Negligible (zero) damping.

The upper mass (the sprung mass) includes the rest of the car itself (divided amongst the four wheels).
It is connected to the unsprung mass by the springs and shock absorbers of the car.
The car weighs 3600 lbf excluding sprung components as detailed above. Assuming
perfectly even weight distribution, each quarter of the car (each corner) will
have a weight of 900 lbf.

The remaining parameters of the suspension design come from the selection of
springs (spring constant/rate) and shock absorbers (damping coefficient).

In this lab, you are to design the suspension _optimally_ for driving
over railroad tracks at 25 mph. You must explicitly define what criteria you choose
for optimization. In order to accomplish this overall goal, complete the following tasks:

- Derive the differential equations governing the displacement of each mass.
- Use your choice of integration algorithm to resolve each mass’s displacement
  upon being excited by the underlying railroad profile using the initial conditions:

$$  
\begin{gather*}
  x_1(t=0) = x_2(t=0) = {0}{\,\rm in} \\
  \dot{x}_1(t=0) = \dot{x}_2(t=0) = {0}{\,\rm in/s}
\end{gather*}
$$

- Integrate the state equations with an explicit forward Euler integration
  _at the very least_. You may then choose to more accurately integrate these
  equations with built-in functions employing higher order RK methods in MATLAB.
- Provide a detailed report including all model parameters and equations, including
  their derivations where appropriate.
- Provide a detailed flowchart describing your algorithm
- Provide a detailed argument for your choice of time step for this integration.

A _suggested_ breakdown to accomplish this in manageable steps is:

### PART I
Design the suspension to ride over a simple sinusoidal rail profile,
$$y(t) = Y_o \sin \omega t$$. Use the rail width to choose the frequency, $\omega$.
Test your algorithm by using a very stiff spring between the masses (to “lock” them
together), a case for which an exact solution exists (from ME 230). Compare your
numerical solution to this analytical solution.

### PART II
Optimally design the suspension for driving over railroad tracks at 25 mph.
Provide a reasoned engineering argument for defining **optimal**.

# Deliverables

Your report (printed copy) and code (email attachments) are due at the beginning
of the Week 9 lab period. The report should (as always) document your work so it
could be duplicated by another student or engineer. This may include, but is not
limited to:

- Discussion of relevant theory.
- Development of the mathematical model (ODEs), including application of simplifying assumptions.
- Development of an algorithm to solve the ODEs numerically.
- Development of an analytical solution (where applicable).
- Discussion of time step selection.
- Discussion of optimization approach.
- Present final results: the suspension design parameters.
- Discussion.

Remember to include references to external material where appropriate and follow
all report/assignment guidelines from the course syllabus.
