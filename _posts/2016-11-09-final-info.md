The final exam will take place from 5:30 pm â€“ 7:30 pm
on Monday of Finals Week (14 November 2016) in our usual classroom (S-210).
You will have the full two hours to complete the exam.

The final exam is closed-book, closed-notes.
The format will be very similar to the midterm: a mix of short answer, multiple choice, and problems to work out. 
You may use a hand calculator.

Please arrive on time with lab reports ready to turn in, so we can start the
exam promptly.

As you review, the equation sheet is available to you at the following link:
[Final Exam Equation Sheet](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/me300/final-equation-sheet.pdf).
I will provide printed copies with the exam, so you don't need to bring your own copy.
