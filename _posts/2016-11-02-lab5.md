title: "Lab 5: Modeling Heat Transfer in a Thin Fin"
categories: lab
---

The one-dimensional heat transfer through a cooling fin on an engine is to be analyzed.
The fin, shown below, has a uniform cross-sectional area and is heated from the left end such that the base is held at a constant temperature, $$T_b$$.
The fin transfers the heat by conduction along its length and convection off to the ambient air surrounding the fin.
The fin is to be modeled with an adiabatic tip; that is, there is no convection from the end of the fin to the ambient air.

From the drawing above, we know that the perimeter of the fin, $$P$$, is $$P=2w+2t$$,
and that the cross-sectional area of the fin, $$A_c$$, is $$A_c=wt$$.

Use the following parameters when modeling the fin:

$$
\begin{align*}
w &= {50}{\, \rm mm}  & t &= {5}{\, \rm mm} & L &= {125}{\, \rm mm} \\
k &= {400}{\, \rm W/(m\, K)} & h &= {100}{\, \rm W/(m^2\, K)} \\
T_b &= {100}{\, ^\circ\rm C} & T_{\infty} &= {25}{\, ^\circ\rm C}
\end{align*}
$$

Use a finite-difference approach to construct a matrix equation modeling the
temperature distribution through the fin at steady-state conditions (no change with time).
The conduction along the length of the fin is modeled by Fourier's law in one dimension:

$$
\begin{equation*}
q_{\text{conduction}} = -k A_c \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x},
\end{equation*}
$$

where $$k$$ is the *thermal conductivity* of the fin material.

The convection between the fin surface and the ambient air is modeled by Newton's law of cooling:

$$
\begin{equation*}
q_{\text{convection}} = h A_s (T - T_{\infty}),
\end{equation*}
$$

where $$h$$ is a *convection coefficient* and
 $$A_s$$ is the area of the fin surface exposed for convection ($$A_s = P \Delta x$$).

We can create a model for the temperature distribution on the fin by breaking it into small pieces.
This concept is similar to the electrical circuit examples presented in Chapter 12 of your textbook[^1].

Starting from an energy balance on each "piece" of the fin, develop a system of equations
to calculate the temperature $$T_i$$ at 5 evenly-spaced locations along the length of the fin.

Note the boundary condition at the base of the fin:
For the first location, $$T_1$$, the temperature is known ($$T_b = {100}{\, ^\circ\rm C}$$),
but the heat transfer rate into the fin, $$q_f$$, is unknown. At all other locations, $$T_i$$ is unknown.

Write a MATLAB program to assemble and solve a matrix equation for this system
using either Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi iteration.
Implement the code such that any number of temperatures may be calculated---the
5-point method you derived above will show a pattern to the matrix that can be
extended to any number of points.

The analytical solution for this problem[^2] is

$$
\begin{align*}
T(x) &= \frac{\cosh(m(L-x))}{\cosh mL} (T_b - T_{\infty}) + T_{\infty}, \\
q_f &= M \tanh mL,
\end{align*}
$$

where $$m$$ and $$M$$ account for the properties and parameters of the fin system:

$$
\begin{equation*}
m = \sqrt{hP/kA_c} \qquad M = \sqrt{hPkA_c} (T_b - T_{\infty}).
\end{equation*}
$$

Compare the temperature profile predicted with your algorithmic solution
to the analytic solution to "validate" your algorithm.
Experiment with the resolution (number of temperature locations/equations) to arrive
at a good balance between accuracy and problem size. Discuss the engineering
reasoning behind your choice of resolution as well as the convergence criteria
for the iterative solution method.

Prepare a report documenting your work. This must include, at minimum:

- Problem statement.
- List of relevant assumptions.
- Mathematical model.
    This should include a derivation of the system of equations (matrix equation) for $$n=5$$ temperatures.
- Solution technique. A description of the algorithmic solution technique.
- Results. Compare the numerical solution method to the analytic (exact) solution.
    Tables and figures may be helpful to show the results concisely.
- Discussion. Justify your choice for the number of equations (temperatures).
    Discuss any differences between the analytic and algorithmic solutions.

The report is due before the final exam period.
