title: "Lab 2: A Damped Pendulum (Week 4/5)"
categories: lab
---

Consider a damped pendulum, where the pendulum bob has a mass
$$m = {1}{\rm\,kg}$$, the pivot exhibits damping from friction with torsional
damping coefficient $$\beta$$, and the pendulum has length $$l$$. The pendulum is
subject to a constant step input torque, $$T$$, from rest at its equilibrium position
($$\theta = 0$$; $$\dot{\theta}=0$$) while the governing differential equation is
given by

$$
  ml^2\ddot{\theta} + \beta\dot{\theta} + mgl\theta = T(t) = T_o = \text{constant},
$$

when the angle is “small”.

For this lab, you are to complete the following tasks.

- Derive the governing ODE for the position of the pendulum bob, $$\theta(t)$$.
- Using the [experimental data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/me300/Pendulum_Data.xlsx) provided:
    - Use the log decrement and the damped period to determine the damping ratio $$\zeta$$
        and the natural frequency $$\omega_N$$.
    - Using $$\zeta$$ and $$\omega_N$$ determined from experiment, calculate
        the effective length $$l$$ of the bob and the rotational damping coefficient $$\beta$$.
        Be sure to include the appropriate units!
    - Using the governing ODE in conjunction with the steady state angle
        determined by the experimental data, estimate the step input applied torque
        $$T_o$$ that produced these data.
    - Produce a table listing your results for $$\beta$$, $$l$$, and $$T_o$$.
- Solve the governing ODE analytically (in functional form) or determine a
      solution using the linear simulator, `lsim`, in MATLAB.
- Numerically integrate the governing ODE for the pendulum motion using
      the explicit forward Euler integration scheme. You must derive and state
      clearly the algorithmic equations you are solving.
- Plot the numerically predicted response on the same graph with the
      experimental data and analytical response.
- Include all MATLAB code in an appendix
- Provide a two page maximum write-up. This need not be a formal report,
      but must be neat, legible and produced in a professional and orderly
      manner.

Additionally, consider an idealization of your model rocket launch. The students have unfortunately
selected the "Buzz Lightyear rocket motor", purported to burn "to infinity and beyond"!
This motor produces a constant thrust of $${121}{\rm\, lbf}$$ for an infinite amount of time.

- Determine through analytical means the velocity as a function of
    time using the linear drag model.
- Assuming a linear drag law, use an explicit forward Euler method,
    Heun’s method, and an implicit backward Euler method to
    determine the rocket’s velocity vs. time. Use a time step $$\Delta t = 3\tau/4$$.
    Plot all three numerically predicted velocity histories
    along with the analytical solution on a single graph. Critically
    comment on your numerical results, in particular whether they
    over-predict or under-predict the theoretical solution and why.
    What would you expect to happen for time step sizes twice as
    large? Half as large?
- Provide a two page maximum write-up. This need not be a formal
    report, but must be neat, legible and produced in a professional and
    orderly manner.

Both write-ups are due at the start of lab in Week 6 and must include all items
outlined above.
