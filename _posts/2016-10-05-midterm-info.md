As discussed in class, the midterm will take place from 5:00 pm â€“ 7:00 pm
on Wednesday of Week 6 (12 October 2016), rather than during the lab period
as mentioned on the syllabus. You will have the full two hours to complete the exam.

Please arrive on time with lab reports ready to turn in, so we can start the
exam promptly.

As you review, the equation sheet is available to you at the following link:
[Midterm Exam Equation Sheet](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/me300/midterm-equation-sheet.pdf).
I will provide printed copies with the exam, so you don't need to bring your own copy.
