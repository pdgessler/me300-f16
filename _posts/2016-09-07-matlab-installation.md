A few notes about installing MATLAB on your MSOE laptops.
You can follow the instructions at MSOE Community's [How To Install MATLAB](https://community.msoe.edu/docs/DOC-5654 "How To Install MATLAB | MSOE Community") webpage.

There are currently two versions of MATLAB on the MSOE application server.
Please install the newest one available.
Unless you already have the older version installed, in which case, don't worry about switching to the newer one.
There are only minor differences between these two releases; nothing that will affect our usage of MATLAB in class.

It's best to do this on campus (attempting over VPN will be unbearably slow) using an ethernet cable.
The installer performs several larger downloads, so ethernet will be faster and more reliable than wireless.
Please consult the IT HelpDesk if you run into problems.
We'll be needing this software for class; please have it installed by class time on Wednesday of Week 2 (5:00 pm, 14 September 2016).
