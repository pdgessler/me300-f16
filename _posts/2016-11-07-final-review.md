title: Final Exam Review Problems/Solutions
categories: doc
---

To review for the exam, you may wish to complete Problems 5.2b and 6.2c (from Chapra 7e).
Complete only two iterations for each problem.
Also review the [Midterm Review Problems/Solutions](https://pdgessler.github.io/me300-f16/doc/2016/10/12/midterm-review.html),
since the exam will be cumulative but focus primarily on post-midterm material.
These problems are totally optional and will not be collected or graded.

The solutions are available [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10724484/me300/FinalReview-Solution.pdf).

Just a reminder, the final exam is closed-book, closed-notes. You may use a hand calculator.
Please arrive on time with lab reports ready to turn in, so we can start the exam promptly.
