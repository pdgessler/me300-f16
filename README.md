# ME 300 111 Fall 2016

You've reached the repository of my course website for ME 300 111 (Fall 2016).

Unless you want to see how I built this website, you are in the wrong place. :-)

The course website proper may be accessed at [http://pdgessler.github.io/me300-f16/](http://pdgessler.github.io/me300-f16/).
